# Homework Class 01

### 1. Create your own repository on GitHub for C# Basic subject (c-sharp-basic-homeworks), if you already haven't. 
- In this repo you will have all your homeworks for the subject divided in subfolders, for example Class01, Class02 etc. where you will put your solutions for the homework.

### 2. Your first solution for which you can test your git skills is to create a console application where you will have to:
* Create a blank solution
* Add new project (console app)
* Simulate a traffic light - it should only show RED, YELLOW and GREEN in new lines with the adequate colors
* Bonus - Wait for the execution of the next line for n seconds using Thread class
