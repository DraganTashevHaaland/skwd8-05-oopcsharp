# Homework Class 4 ðŸ“’

## Task 0
* Create a new method called Substrings
* In that method enter the following string :
  * "Hello from SEDC Codecademy v7.0"
* Ask the user to enter a number n.
* Print the first n characters from that string and print the length of the new string.
* Make sure that the user can only enter a number and the number should be from 1 to the number of characters in the string ( canâ€™t enter an integer larger than the length of the string )

## Task 1:
Create a function to say whether a string is symmetric (a palindrome). For example, "RADAR" is a palindrome.

## Task 2:
Create a function which returns the greatest value stored in an array of real numbers which is specified as parameter.

## Task 3:
Create a two function that calculates the amount of numeric digits and vowels(samoglaski) that a text string contains.
It will accept one parameter parameter: the string that we want to search,
 * Function 1 should return the number of digits, 
 * Function 2 should return the number of vowels. 
# Do not name them function1 and 2 :)

## Task 4:
Create a function to read a sentence from input and replace lowercase characters by uppercase and vice-versa.

## Task 5:
Create a function to check whether a character is an alphabet or not and if so go to check for the case.

## Task 6:
Create a function to find the number of times a substring appears in a given string.

## Task 7:
Create a function that calculates the result of raising an integer to another integer (eg 5 raised to 3 = 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125). 


## Task 8: Bonus
* Make a method called AgeCalculator
* The method will have one input parameter, your birthday date
* The method should return your age
* Show the age of a user after he inputs a date

> Note: take into consideration if the birthday is today, after or before today

# Good luck and happy coding
